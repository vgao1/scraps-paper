<p class='lede'>One of the things I like most about MIT is finding out about the varying career paths that alums take. Mark Driscoll &#39;92 is one who took the path less traveled. Mr. Driscoll started the Hollywood based Look Effects, a visual effects company that has worked on films including &quot;Apocalypto,&quot; &quot;Blood Diamond,&quot; &quot;The Fountain,&quot; and the upcoming &quot;Next&quot; and &quot;Gone Baby Gone.&quot; I talked with Mr. Driscoll a few weeks ago about what he actually does and how he went from MIT to making movies.</p>

<p class='lede'>During my time at MIT, I have learned that the best thing to do on a Friday night is to grab some friends and go to a MITSO concert, which is possible about twice a term. When I got to Kresge last Friday, I was delighted to see a large audience that apparently felt the same way despite the surprisingly inclement weather. Under the baton of conductor Paul M. Biss, MITSO again delivered an uplifting performance, featuring the all-time favorites Grieg&#39;s &quot;Peer Gynt Suite&quot; and Stravinsky&#39;s &quot;Firebird.&quot; The program also included Beethoven&#39;s &quot;Symphony No. 1&quot; and Mozart&#39;s early masterpiece, the cantata &quot;Exsultate, Jubilate&quot;, with soprano Elisabeth Hon G, winner of the MITSO concerto competition.</p>

<p class='lede'>A new romantic comedy opening at Kendall Cinema gets its enigmatic title, &quot;Starter for 10,&quot; from the British game show, &quot;University Challenge.&quot; Apparently, British people would catch this reference and it would mean something for them. However, the reference is lost on us Americans, but that isn&#39;t too important because &quot;University Challenge&quot; isn&#39;t really the focus of the movie, and the storyline never really pans out. Then again, I am not really sure what the focus of &quot;Starter for 10&quot; is&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt; The main point is that there is a college freshman, Brian (James McAvoy) and he has two love interests, Alice (Alice Eve) and Rebecca (Rebecca Epstein).</p>

<p class='lede'>ArsLatina and Sony Classical have recently presented an homage to Ennio Morricone&#39;s masterpieces, interpreted by a surprisingly heterogeneous group of musical masters, from Yo-Yo Ma to Metallica. The anthology could hardly have a more auspicious timing: it comes on the heels of the Italian composer receiving an honorary Oscar at the 79th Annual Academy Awards. Furthermore, the album opens with &quot;I Knew I Loved You,&quot; the same song that Celine Dion sang on the same Oscar Night that the composer received his award. In it, Dion still displays the warmth and shine of her prime, which when combined with flawless orchestration, make this the best song of the album.</p>

<p class='lede'>Have you ever had the experience of seeing a photo of something and knowing immediately that it was for you? Maybe you noticed a picture of a restaurant and declared it would become your new favorite, though you&#39;d never tasted the dish depicted. Or how about seeing the cover of a book and knowing you want to read it, even though you&#39;ve never even heard of the author (forgetting what they say about not judging a book by its cover)? Dear Reader, I want you to know you&#39;re far from alone. Humans rely on vision more than any sense (unless, of course, you&#39;re a human without sight, in which case this review will be relevant in just a moment, so bear with me) and so it&#39;s perfectly plausible that sight serves as a &quot;gateway sense&quot; for other perceptive experiences.</p>

The four groups were selected as some of the best in the area and included the MIT Logarhythms along with the Brandeis Voicemale, Harvard Low Keys, and the Tufts Beelzebubs (&quot;Bubs&quot;). While this competition had judges, they only provided comments; it was the live audience of 1200 that would actually decide the afternoon&#39;s winner.</p>

<p class='lede'>Perhaps it says something about me, but &lt;i&gt;Dirty Rotten Scoundrels&lt;/i&gt; has been one of my favorite movies since the age of seven. Starring Michael Caine and Steve Martin, this movie about two con-men trying to one up each other in the French Riviera was just about the funniest thing I’d ever seen. Thus when I heard a musical based on it was coming out, I was both thrilled and worried. Since I love the original and I love musicals, it had the potential to be magnificent. Of course, if they messed it up and tarnished the good name of &lt;i&gt;Scoundrels&lt;/i&gt;, it would be a bitter disappointment on the order of &lt;i&gt;The Matrix Reloaded&lt;/i&gt;. Finally, after years of fear, I bit the bullet and saw the show. My hopes were realized: it was really good.</p>

After all, what could be more romantic than stepping into Boston&#39;s own Little Italy, with plenty of beautiful and elegant dining areas seen through almost every window?

<p class='lede'>Last Friday, MIT chamber music enthusiasts had the special opportunity to hear the highly acclaimed Audubon String Quartet perform in Kresge Auditorium. In addition to Mozart&#39;s string quintet K.515, the program also included two string quartets by Mozart (K.458) and Shostakovich (No.5). The captivating performances, the intimate music, the large and enthusiastic audience, all contributed to a decidedly worthwhile musical experience.</p>

<p class='lede'>What&#39;s different? More specifically, what did the flagship indie pop band of this decade lose or gain by waiting almost four years in between releases? The crest of the Shins&#39; popularity was arguably the prominent use of their songs in the hit 2004 film&lt;i&gt; Garden State&lt;/i&gt;. A sensible band would&#39;ve put something out soon after either to capitalize on their newfound recognition or to quickly and decisively steer their music away from any association with idiot-savant/idiot Zach Braff, or — if they&#39;re particularly devious — both. Thankfully, the Shins&#39; newest album, &lt;i&gt;Wincing the Night Away&lt;/i&gt;, is good enough — great enough, in fact — to make their intentions irrelevent.</p>

<p class='lede'>George Balanchine&#39;s ballet, &lt;i&gt;A Midsummer Night&#39;s Dream&lt;/i&gt;, conveys Shakespeare&#39;s tale of love and magic through a compelling interaction of vibrant visuals, exquisite choreography, and Mendelssohn&#39;s stirring score. The ballet debuted in New York City in 1962 and has finally found its way to Boston for the first time.</p>

<p class='lede'>Last week marked the sixth annual MIT production of the &lt;i&gt;The Vagina Monologues&lt;/i&gt;, a series of short skits designed to break the cultural taboos surrounding women&#39;s issues. Specifically, the production addresses worldwide violence against women and related atrocities by exploiting the power of theater as a forum for uninhibited speech. Young women — typically one at a time, as the title suggests — deliver stories of love, terror, happiness, strife, and hope as told through their adopted characters, most of which are based on the accounts of actual women interviewed by playwright Eve Ensler.</p>
