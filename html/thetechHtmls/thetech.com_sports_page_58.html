<p class='lede'>This past Saturday Chad Martinovich celebrated his first opening win as the football head coach at MIT, as the Engineers defeated Becker College 21-13. Despite a few kinks early on in the skirmish, MIT dominated the game in statistics, racking up 343 offensive yards to the Hawks’ 175. The Engineers’ ground attack, led by Marcel B. Sanchez ’12, rushed for 252 yards and three touchdowns, Both the offense and defense played soundly. With a new attitude surrounding the team, MIT football may be back on the path to respectability after a disappointing one-win season last fall.</p>

<p class='lede'>This past Saturday, MIT women’s tennis played their first match of the season against Smith College.  The match started off with the doubles matches. First off was the freshmen doubles team of Lauren C. Quisenberry ’14 and Julia C. Hsu ’14. They breezed through their match and won decisively, 8-1. Next off were Melissa A. Diskin ’11 and Katharine A. O’Neal ’14. They played a tough match but lost 2-8; this made the overall score tied at 1-1. The next team to finish was Jenny C. Dohlman ‘11 and Jennifer A. Rees ’11. They were down 2-4 in their match, but they quickly changed the momentum to win the next six games straight to take the match 8-4, giving MIT a 2-1 lead over Smith. Sonya Makhni ’11 and Hillary E. Jenny ’12 were the last ones on court. The match was close with both sides fighting for every point, but MIT pulled it out in the tiebreaker for the win, 9-8(5).</p>

<p class='lede'>When I moved from the homeland of future Washington Nationals’ star Chien-Ming Wang (that would be Taiwan) to New England ten years ago, I suppose the Patriots were my “new home team”. However, sports loyalties are complicated. My father converted (some people would say “matured”) from a Yankees fan to a Red Sox fan over the course of his life, and I’m still not sure how he did it. As the Red Sox falter this year, I make concerted efforts to attach myself to a playoff-bound National League team (the Phillies); I wear the hat, follow them in the standings, but still struggle to attach myself to this team.</p>

<p class='lede'>Boom! TD Bank Garden erupted in cheers as the lights went down and pyrotechnics fired off on Monday night. “Sports” entertainment company World Wrestling Entertainment aired their 900th episode of Monday Night RAW. Since its debut 17 years ago on January 11, 1993, the WWE has produced the most episodes in the history of primetime TV. In fact according to a fun fact displayed during a commercial break, if MTV’s Jersey Shore continues to run at its current rate, it will reach its 900th episode in 2083 when Snooki is 96 which is older than Betty White’s current age.</p>

<p class='lede'>All summer, I’ve read about the declining TV and radio audiences for the Red Sox, but in order to gain a full grasp on the changing market for Red Sox baseball, I needed to go down to Fenway and wait in line for seats. In years past, I’d arrive outside the ticket window at Gate E a full five hours in advance of the first pitch and find thirty to fifty people camped out in the shadow of the Green Monster, spread out on blankets, sipping coffee, and listening to radio hosts dissect the Red Sox. As I arrived on Saturday morning at the ballpark two and a half hours before game time, I found just eight people in line ahead of me. In the thirty minutes between my arrival and the time tickets went on sale, the line in front of me dwindled to a mere four people as scalpers offered face value for “box seats” (be wary of scalpers: aside from the fact that the seats are grouped in rectangular sections, there was nothing “box” about those seats). The first-row, infield grandstand seats that I purchased offered an excellent view of what promised to be an intriguing pitchers’ duel in the first game of Saturday’s double-header.</p>

<p class='lede'>In Boston, the Bruins won’t win a popularity contest with the Red Sox, Patriots, or Celtics, but their hardcore fans are true Bostonians and as dedicated to their team as any fans of the other New England sports teams. For those unfamiliar with the game of ice hockey, imagine a sport which, like soccer, is a low-scoring affair, but unlike soccer, permits physicality between players and doesn’t reward those who like to fake injuries. It also represents one of the best ways to have fun when you’re near a frozen body of water and can’t go anywhere because there’s too much snow (this is New England for about four months out of the year). Many Bruins fans, unlike fans of franchises in the southern United States, have fond memories of playing the game with family and friends. Collegiate hockey (the BU Terriers and the BC Eagles are among the top teams in the nation) is extremely popular around Boston as well.</p>

Five and a half games behind the Rays, the Red Sox needed to take at least two out of three in the series to position the team for the last month of the season. A promising start stoked playoff hopes, but the rest of the weekend left Red Sox nation in a somber state of mind.

<p class='lede'>The 2010 FIFA World Cup begins on June 11 in Johannesburg as the host, South Africa, take on their Group A opponents, Mexico. It will be the first tournament to be hosted by an African country and the first in which the host nation, not the defending champions (this year Italy, which won on 2004), will play the opening match.</p>

<p class='lede'>Nine members of the MIT cycling team competed in the Collegiate Road Nationals, held May 7-9 in Madison, Wisconsin. The event opened on Friday with an incredibly challenging road race at Blue Mound State Park. Rain, temperatures in the 40’s, and over 8,000 feet of climbing over 70 miles made the men’s race a race of attrition, with only half the starters finishing the race. John Dreher G was MIT’s first finisher, in a solid 18th place, even though he had upgraded to A’s just three weeks before nationals. Despite riding the last 10 miles of the race with a broken shifter cable, forcing him to run up the steep hills, John Rhoden G placed 27th.  After spending much of the race chasing after getting a flat tire, Tim Humpton ’10 finished in 32nd place.</p>
