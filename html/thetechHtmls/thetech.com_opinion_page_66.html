Hillary Clinton, the State Department’s warrior princess, declared that Iran is transforming from a theocracy to an outright military dictatorship. Clinton’s statement came after the Senate overwhelmingly voted for punitive sanctions against Iran including denying the Iranian people essential household items such as gasoline.</p>

<p class='lede'>In George Washington’s farewell address, the president warned of the growing influence of partisanship and the dangers of entangling alliances abroad. In Dwight Eisenhower’s goodbye, the president intoned menacingly about the creation of what he called a “military-industrial complex” and its undue influence on the American political landscape. George Bush’s farewell address was devoted to one topic — terrorism — and though the tenor was optimistic, the message was clear: Our enemies remain, and they will attack us again.</p>

<p class='lede'>The most visible and most highly touted aspects of MIT are its faculty and student body. But amid the faculty and students are thousands of hard workers who make possible everything that students and researchers do. The MIT custodians, administrative assistants, police, and countless other employees are just as much part of the MIT culture and success as are the students, faculty, and those ridiculously overworked and underpaid things commonly called post-docs. For anyone who considers the importance of the MIT labor force, it is immediately clear that MIT’s success depends on the groundskeepers, police, staff, custodians, and other facilities personnel. Many of the MIT workers have been on campus for a long time and know the ins-and-outs of the facilities better than anyone else. They know where money is wasted and where inefficiencies arise. With this in mind, it is only logical that the top MIT administrators should make it a priority to maintain and invest in the MIT workforce. MIT administration should consider the campus workforce as an essential partner that is to be respected as much as the faculty and student bodies.</p>

Along with that comes the prerequisite that they keep the ring design controlled and only release it when they are ready to.

<p class='lede'>It shouldn’t be necessary at this point, but given the pockets of feigned disbelief that remain abroad, it deserves repeating: The Iranians are developing nuclear weapons. Rhetorically, they continue to maintain the pretense of pursuing peaceful nuclear power, but the structure of their program belies its true nature as a weapons development effort. Their near-exclusive focus on isotopic enrichment, their construction of clandestine facilities, and their recent decision to enrich uranium to levels higher than what is necessary for commercial power plants are all signals that should remove whatever doubt remains of Iranian intentions. What Iran has achieved to date amounts to a small but growing breakout capacity. If they continue on their current pace, by mid-2010 they will have enough low-to-medium enriched uranium to produce several atomic bombs and the centrifuge capacity to bring that material to weapons readiness within a few months.</p>

<p class='lede'>In the wake of several hasty decisions by the MIT administration such as the decision to convert Green Hall to a sorority residence, a string of hacking incidents that resulted in arrests, the Star Simpson statement, and transparency problems surrounding the preliminary Blue Ribbon Dining Committee report, members of the MIT community began to evaluate the framework of student engagement. Administrators bolstered their communication staff and refined their methods of connecting and involving students in important decisions. Some faculty members began to question the merits and foresight of these decisions. Student leaders asked for more direct methods of communicating with senior members of the administration, which lead to the formation of the Task Force of Student Engagement (now the Student Engagement Committee).</p>

<p class='lede'>When reading Maggie Liu’s article entitled “College admissions is no scam ­— just reflection of socioeconomic disparity” from the January 20 issue of &lt;i&gt;The Tech&lt;/i&gt;, I got the impression that the writer, like many others before her, seems to be of the opinion that education, regardless of being superior or inferior, fundamentally shapes individuals rather than being in many respects shaped by them. College students, regardless of their prior education and social conditions can equally benefit when democracy is infused in the process of receiving and exchanging knowledge in and outside of the class rooms. Nowadays, when the issue of democracy and higher education is brought up, it usually alludes to extending social justice and providing access to higher education for those groups in society that are disadvantaged due to lingering discrimination based on color of skin or national origin, among others, or due to lack of financial means. Even though this is still an ongoing situation, institutions of higher education like Northeastern University have been taking measures to combat the issue by providing financial aid and promoting affirmative action and diversity. Ironically, these same measures are now being blamed for having lowered the standards of higher education. I, however, have a different take on having these two concepts, democracy and education. I believe they form a complementary rather than opposing or antithetical relationship.</p>

<p class='lede'>The public face of MIT is 77 Massachusetts Avenue. The building, with its imposing Ionic porch and lofty interior, is not only an architectural landmark in its own right, but also the gateway into the world of MIT. The lobby — officially titled the William Barton Rogers Lobby, but more popularly called Lobby 7 — was designed in 1939 by William Welles Bosworth as the culminating element of the campus that he designed and that was built in 1916. Ever since the completion of Lobby 7, the four plinths that define the corners of the great rotunda have remained empty. They were originally intended as bases celebrating Aristotle, Ictinus, Archimedes, and Callicrates. </p>
