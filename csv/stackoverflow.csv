c#,GridView HyperLink field in C#,"11 years, 7 months ago","4 years, 11 months ago","
                        Asked
                        11 years, 7 months ago
                    ",Sam,"
                
Take a look at the following code:

<asp:HyperLinkField 
    DataNavigateUrlFields=""NameID"" 
    DataNavigateUrlFormatString=""names.aspx?nameid={0}""
    DataTextField=""name"" 
    HeaderText=""Name"" 
    ItemStyle-Width=""100px""
    ItemStyle-Wrap=""true"" />


It takes only the name id to navigate to the next page. How will I include the two other parameters which are not in the gridview. The navigate URL I'm using has to take the keyword which is already present in the gridview and the other two parameters from the database table. I tried using all these codes. Nothing did work for me. 

<asp:HyperLinkField DataTextField=""Keyword"" DataNavigateUrlFields=""Keyword""
    DataNavigateUrlFormatString=""KeywordSrchSumDtl.aspx?Keyword={0}&State={1}&City={2}""
    HeaderStyle-VerticalAlign=""Bottom"" ItemStyle-HorizontalAlign=""center"" />


I cant use the above the code because the state and city are not in the GridView but available in my data table.

I tried using the following code too, but it doesn't work:

 <asp:TemplateField HeaderText=""Keyword""  ItemStyle-HorizontalAlign=""Center"" FooterStyle-HorizontalAlign=""Center"">
    <ItemTemplate>
        <asp:HyperLink ID=""link"" runat=""server"" NavigateUrl='<% # ""KeywordSrchSumDtl.aspx?Keyword=""Eval(""Keyword"")+""&State=""+Request.QueryString[""State""]%>' Text='<%# Eval(""Keyword"") %>'>
        </asp:HyperLink>
    </ItemTemplate>
</asp:TemplateField>


I also tried this:

        <asp:HyperLink ID=""Link1"" runat=""Server"" NavigateUrl='<%#redirectURL()+Server.UrlEncode((Eval(""Keyword"")).ToString())%>' Text='<%# DataBinder.Eval(Container.DataItem,""Keyword"") %>'>
        </asp:HyperLink>
    </ItemTemplate>
</asp:TemplateField>


.aspx.cs

return ""KeywordSrchSumDtl.aspx?Keyword="" + 
    //I DONNO HOW TO CALL THE KEYWORD HERE//
    + ""&State="" + System.Web.HttpContext.Current.Request.QueryString[""State""]
    + ""&City="" + System.Web.HttpContext.Current.Request.QueryString[""City""];


I don't know how to solve this.
    ","
Use the DataNavigateUrlFields property, comma-delimited value with the fields for parameters in ""KeywordSrchSumDtl.aspx?Keyword={0}&State={1}&City={2}""

<asp:HyperLinkField DataNavigateUrlFields=""Keyword,State,City""
                    DataNavigateUrlFormatString=""KeywordSrchSumDtl.aspx?Keyword={0}&State={1}&City={2}"" 
                    Text=""View Details"" />

I have being seeing crashes in my iOS app, when opening LA Times (www.latimes.com). The crash happens in WebCore somewhere and I have no clue where. Profiling with both ""Zombie"" or ""leaks"" do not return anything for this ""EXE_BAD_ADDRESS"" error.

I also checked with a small, bare UIWebView app and I could reproduce the effects. 

Right now, I see this happening only with LA times, but I am not sure if there are other sites as well. 

Can someone check on and guide me in what could be the possible error/source for this crash?

EDIT: I have added a small UIWebView project demonstrating this bug at
github

EDIT 2: The app (include the demo at github) works perfectly fine on iOS 7.0, but crashes in iOS 7.1 ... seems a recent bug with iOS 7.1. I have issued a bug report to Apple and will keep updated.

You can try with string.Format method

NavigateUrl='<%# String.Format(""KeywordSrchSumDtl.aspx?Keyword={0}&State={1}&City={2}"", DataBinder.Eval(Container.DataItem, ""Keyword""), Request.QueryString[""State""], Request.QueryString[""City""]) %>'

in the commentaries to one of the post (quote):

-If all the DispatcherTimer does is kick off another thread, what is the point of using the DispatcherTimer?
....those threads don't need to be started on the UI thread. You could just use a regular Timer and avoid interrupting the UI altogether

What is ""a regular timer"" that is meant? How they (""DispatcherTimer"" and ""a regular Timer"") differ regarding their impact on UI?

The source to a small WPF program is shown below. It lists the directories under c:\windows in a DataGrid. The name is a link that can be clicked to open the directory in Explorer. 

(This is just a proof of concept program to illustrate the question.)

Here's what it looks like:



Instead of only being able to click on the link to run the open action, I'd also like to set it up so that the user can press the o key when a row is highlighted in order to run the open action.

What's a good way to set this up? Note that the program is primarily specified in C# as opposed to XAML so if possible, please post your solution in C#. However, if necessary, XAML answers are welcome too!

I happened to bump into that same issue with one of my apps in iOS>7.0 only.

It seems to be a sync issue which can be fixed by creating the webview from the main thread only. 

As a fix I just wrapped my UIWebView creation in a dispatch_sync(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{ ... }); 

And it solved the problem.
Of course if your code is running on the main thread you shouldn't wrap it this way ;)

DispatcherTimer is the regular timer.  It fires its Tick event on the UI thread, you can do anything you want with the UI.  System.Timers.Timer is an asynchronous timer, its Elapsed event runs on a thread pool thread.  You have to be very careful in your event handler, you are not allowed to touch any UI component or data-bound variables.  And you'll need to use the lock statement where ever you access class members that are also used on the UI thread.

In the linked answer, the Timer class was more appropriate because the OP was trying to run code asynchronously on purpose.

Regular Timer's Tick event is actually fired on the thread where the Timer was created, so in the tick event, in order to access anything with the UI, you will have to go through dispatcher.begininvoke as mentioned below.

RegularTimer_Tick(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    txtBox1.Text = ""count"" + i.ToString(); 
    // error can not access
    // txtBox1.Text property outside dispatcher thread...

    // instead you have to write...
    Dispatcher.BeginInvoke( (Action)delegate(){
       txtBox1.Text = ""count "" + i.ToString();
    });
}


In case of Dispatcher Timer, you can access UI elements without doing begin invoke or invoke as follow...

DispatcherTimer_Tick(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    txtBox1.Text = ""Count "" + i.ToString();
    // no error here..
}


DispatcherTimer just provides convenience over Regular Timer to access UI objects easily.

        timer.Interval = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(20);
        timer.Tick += new EventHandler(async (object s, EventArgs a) =>
        {
            Message = ""Updating..."";
            await UpdateSystemStatus(false);  
            Message = ""Last updated "" + DateTime.Now;              
        });
        timer.Start();

I'm trying to parse the result from a RESTFull call using RestTemplate following this sample http://thekspace.com/home/component/content/article/57-restful-clients-in-spring-3.html

The XML Response is something like that:

<brands>
    <brand>
        <nodeRef>1111111</nodeRef>
        <name>Test</name>
    </brand>
</brands>


For first, I configured my application-context.xml like that:

<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?>

        </property>
    </bean>


</beans>


The class com.kipcast.dataModel.drugs.bean.BrandViewList is a bean with an @XStreamAlias(""brand"") defined.

Here how I do the rest call:

ApplicationContext applicationContext = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext(""application-context.xml"", WebscriptCaller.class); 
RestTemplate restTemplate = applicationContext.getBean(""restTemplate"", RestTemplate.class);     

String url = ""http://localhost:8081/alfresco/service/search/brand.xml?q={keyword}&alf_ticket={ticket}""; 
List<BrandViewList> results = (List<BrandViewList>) restTemplate.getForObject(url, List.class, params);


WebscriptCaller.class is the class from which I execute these instructions.

When I try to execute that, the getForObject() fails and I get that exception:

XStream unmarshalling exception; nested exception is com.thoughtworks.xstream.mapper.CannotResolveClassException: brands


My question is, how can I fix that? Why I get this kind of Exception? How can I tell him to skip  root tag?

-------------- UPDATED --------------
fixed some issue and in particular:

List<Brand> brandViewList = (List<Brand>) restTemplate.getForObject(url, Brand.class, params);


but the result now is:

As I understood there are two questions to answer:


  Why does my program crash when I include glewExperimental = GL_TRUE; but not when leaving it away?


Your program crashes because it cannot load the glew library. When you leave this line away, no call to glew is made and the program will most likely not even load it.


  Why does my program not find glew32.dll although I copied it into the system32 folder?


If you have a 64-bit operating system, than system32 is the folder where the 64-bit dlls are placed. I know this sounds sic!, but that's how windows works. 32-bit libraries are located in SysWOW64. This SO-answer contains more details about this: why-do-64-bit-dlls-go-to-system32-and-32-bit-dlls-to-syswow64-on-64-bit-windows.

In general you should never place dlls somewhere in the windows folder. This folders are reserved for system libraries/system-wide libraries like drivers etc. The reason for this is, that you get into deep troubles if someone else copies another version of e.g. glew32.dll into the system folder, which will most probably crash you app. The best way to place your own libraries is in the directory your executable lies in.

The code is using a combination of .each() AND a for-in loop... and strangely the callback from a blur() function? It can be simplified like this:

var amount = 0;
$('#bill_amount:disabled, #fine, #discount, #other_cost')
  .blur()
  .each(function() {
    var sign = this.id === 'discount' ? -1 : 1;
    amount += parseFloat($(this).val()) * sign;
  });
$('#total').val(amount);




Update:

Oh, you want the total to update on blur... try this code:

var $values = $('#bill_amount:disabled, #fine, #discount, #other_cost');
$values.on('blur', function() {
  var amount = 0;
  $values.each(function(){
    var sign = this.id === 'discount' ? -1 : 1;
    amount += parseFloat($(this).val()) * sign;
  });
  $('#total').val(amount);
});

The jQuery() method returns jQuery objects, not numbers or even strings. Forcing a number cast will thus return NaN.

You need to first grab the text inside and than parse numbers of out it. How to do it depends on how your HTML is structured but in general:


In form fields you can normally use .val()
In most other tags you can use .text()

Make sure that all values are interpreted as numbers by JavaScript. Otherwise it will try to calculate some odd result from a string, which might get interpreted as something else than the a decimal number (hex, octa, ...).

If there are not too many columns, you could just
directly 
UPDATE each by your_column_name, via the TRIM() function:

UPDATE mytable SET 
mycolumn1 = TRIM(mycolumn1), 
mycolumn2 = TRIM(mycolumn2),
mycolumn3 = TRIM(mycolumn3),
mycolumn4 = TRIM(mycolumn4)


Otherwise, ZweiStein's answer above for a single table,
or Izhar Aazmi's answer for an entire database  seem the way to go.

Hiram's answer to  another SO Post includes a check to only TRIM VARCHAR fields: excellent feature!

Or, if using T-SQL, or others which do not support TRIM,  use the LTRIM(RTRIM(...)) trick,
 suggested by Jim Rubenstein and Denis de Bernardy above.

I was actually looking for something similar for a legacy table that's constantly updated by an outside source when I came across this question. I realize the OP was looking for a purely SQL(MySQL) answer, but in case you use Rails, you might find this tidbit that I came up with helpful:

MyModel.update_all(MyModel.columns.map(&:name).map{|x| ""#{x} = TRIM(#{x})""}.join(', '))


You can also wrap it into a class method in your model

class MyModel < ActiveRecord::Base
  def self.trim_all
   update_all(columns.map(&:name).map{|x| ""#{x} = TRIM(#{x})""}.join(', '))
 end
end


Then call it like this

MyModel.trim_all

You can use PHP for it ( in order to avoid sql errors, better print queries then execute them later ) : 

$dbHost = 'localhost';
$dbUsername = 'root';
$dbPassword = '';
$dbName = 'database';
$db = new mysqli($dbHost, $dbUsername, $dbPassword, $dbName);
$db->set_charset(""utf8"");

$queries = '';
$query=""SELECT * from table"";
$result = $db->query($query);
$headers = $result->fetch_fields();
foreach($headers as $header) {
        $col = $header->name;

       $queries .= ""UPDATE table SET `"".$col.""` = TRIM(`"".$col.""`) </br>"";
}
echo $queries;

Without Plotly Express, you could try the following:

Define the colours:

You can actually use the argument marker_colors from go.Pie() to map values (colors) to labels. You just need to create a dict correlating label:color and use it like that:
gender_color = {'Female':'pink', 'Male':'blue', 'Other':'yellow'}

fig = make_subplots(rows=1, cols=3, specs=[[{'type':'domain'}, {'type':'domain'},{'type':'domain'}]])
fig.add_trace(go.Pie(labels=age[""Age_Group""], values=age[""percent""],customdata=age[""ACC_ID""], textinfo='label+percent',insidetextorientation='horizontal', textfont=dict(color='#000000'), marker_colors=px.colors.qualitative.Plotly),1, 1)

It seems that color_discrete_map is what you're after.
You can create a dictionary with the desired tags as keys and corresponding color HEX codes as values.
palette = {""Male"": ""#0064FF"",""Female"":""#FF8FDF"", ""Other"": ""#FFC300""}

Then pass it as a parameter into your pie() chart.

EDIT: updated to contain only pertaining information

It's best if you have distinct classes handling ""brands"" and ""brand"" tags. I would create a Brand class, rename BrandList to Brands (to be closer to the XML parts they refer to), and let Brands hold a List<Brand>. Put the proper annotations to both classes and you should be done, e.g.:

@XStreamAlias(""brands"")
class Brands {
  @XStreamImplicit
  List<Brand> brand;
}

@XStreamAlias(""brand"")
class Brand {
  String nodeRef;
  String name;
}


The above code works perfectly when marshalling objects to XML, but fails as you describe when unmarshalling from XML to objects. For that to work fine, you need to tell the marshaller which annotated classes you have:

<bean name=""marshaller"" class=""org.springframework.oxm.xstream.XStreamMarshaller"">
    <property name=""autodetectAnnotations"" value=""true""/>
    <property name=""annotatedClasses"">
