<p class='lede'>As the clinical director for campus life at MIT Medical, I’ve been fortunate to partner with dedicated and passionate students to advance many health-related projects in the last six years. During that time, my colleagues at MIT Medical and I have given considerable thought to approaches to support the health of individual students, but also the entire campus community. As a means of advancing this dialogue, I’d like to share our philosophy with you and discuss some areas where we can continue to improve.</p>

Moreover, I doubt that the author even knows what &lt;i&gt;basic&lt;/i&gt; human rights means, especially to people living in China.</p>

<p class='lede'>Restoring America’s standing in the world must surely rank as the next administration’s foremost priority. Unfortunately, the three remaining presidential candidates have yet to articulate a clear strategy for achieving this (admittedly daunting) objective. Whoever prevails in November should ground their strategy in seven principles and policies. I do not regard the first three as particularly controversial — the experiences of the past decade or so yield them quite naturally — and, as such, I present them without comment:</p>

<p class='lede'>I have never really been too energized about the cause of Tibet (worthy, no doubt, but just not one of my “pet” causes) and was somewhat ambivalent on the whole issue of the Olympics in China. On one hand, it would be nice to have the Olympics hosted in a place that was more representative of the values the Games are so frequently said to stand for, on the other hand it would be a bit hypocritical of me not to allow my televised sports entertainment to come from a place that already produces pretty much everything else I consume. Even the fact that China is taking this chance as an opportunity to show off its new-found wealth didn’t bother me — hosting and competing in Olympic Games has always been about nationalism, determining who has the best genes, the best doctors, the best coaches, and sometimes even the best athletes. However, the seemingly organized uproar that has been created by an apparently significant portion of the Chinese population at MIT and elsewhere to the vocal criticisms of a few semi-organized activists has managed to change my mind.</p>

<p class='lede'>Amal Dorai G mischaracterizes my letter from last week. Far from saying that we should accommodate the intolerance of other cultures, I was posing a question — how do we reconcile our liberal society (here I use “liberal” in its classical sense) with respect for multicultural diversity, when some of our own values, such as respect for the rights of homosexuals, conflict with those of other cultures? Do we dare to assert the superiority of civilized Western liberalism over the medieval puritanism which still persists in some parts of the world today? Dorai seems to think so, and his letter suggests that it is ridiculous to think otherwise — he believes it is “ludicrous” to accommodate another culture’s bigotry.</p>

<p class='lede'>Whose idea was it to give far more page space to Baker House’s Piano Drop than the UA presidential elections? Last time I checked, two broken pianos don’t have a say in whether I have to eat in a dining hall or if incoming freshmen get their choice of living groups. The UA may not be the most well-liked group on campus, but without a doubt it is one of the most influential and their elections (which determine who represents me and the entire undergraduate community to the administration) deserve a bit more attention. At least we know that if Baker House decides to drop the UA Exec Board off a roof, everyone will hear about it.</p>

<p class='lede'>Last week, we saw a significant policy shift on greenhouse gas emissions when President Bush called for a halt in the growth of U.S. emissions by 2025 and urged other major polluting nations to develop national goals to address climate change. On the same day, South Korea’s president started a visit to the U.S. to make a pitch to companies and investors to assist the country’s desire to become an energy producer following the discovery of deposits of gas hydrates — crystalline solids of methane and water molecules — off its coast last year. The country’s aspirations are understandable. They would, however, add to emissions from methane released during extraction. Gas hydrates have also been found in large quantities off the coasts of China, India, and Taiwan, all of which have increasing energy demands.</p>

<p class='lede'>How MIT responds to Artem Krasnoslobodtsev’s incendiary e-mail to the Sloan LGBT group will impact how the Institute is viewed by the public. Indeed, as an alumnus, I learned about the incident by reading the &lt;i&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/i&gt;’s Best of the Web column. &lt;i&gt;The Tech&lt;/i&gt; editorial written on April 15 compares the harsh three-semester suspension of Burns Schilling ’02 to the comparatively light punishment meted out to Krasnoslobodtsev, and asks “How does Kraus’s case differ from Schilling’s?” One difference is that Krasnoslobodtsev did not grow up in the U.S., as is pointed out in a published letter from the Sloan LGBT student group, while Schilling did grow up here, presumably. The Committee on Discipline may not have expected from Krasnoslobodtsev the same respect for the freedom of homosexuals that we would expect from Schilling.</p>

<p class='lede'>An editorial cartoon serves as a visual metaphor to express satire towards political issues. Last week’s cartoons (Page 4 of &lt;i&gt;The Tech&lt;/i&gt;, April 8, 2008 and April 11, 2008) imply that China does not deserve to host the Olympics because of human rights issues. While we do not deny that China still has many problems, many Chinese and Chinese Americans are concerned about China’s image in the West. We are concerned that many Americans and other citizens of other Western countries have an outdated and distorted view towards China.</p>

<p class='lede'>In an age where you can learn more about a person from the internet than you can from meeting him or her face to face, leave it to me to have not “Googled” myself since my first semester at MIT nearly 6 years ago. I recently left Cambridge to begin graduate school, and I couldn’t help but begin to wonder whether my new friends and colleagues were sneaking a curious peek at my life via Google, MySpace, Facebook, and the like. I searched for my name today and unfortunately came upon an article which, to this day, still irks me with its inaccuracies and implications as to my actions as well as those of my sisters during recruitment: “AEPhi’s Return to Jewish Identity Spurs De-pledgings, De-affiliations.” As such, I would like to take the opportunity to correct a few things.</p>

<p class='lede'>The role of Undergraduate Association President is rigorous, time-consuming, and often thankless. It is no insignificant challenge to provide guidance and leadership to the UA committees, supply a voice to the Senate, maintain relationships with other student governments, and develop a rapport with the “powers that be” on campus. An outstanding President must do all these things while constantly fighting for the interests of students. And the UA President must do so in a system that, by design, discounts students’ voice. Only candidates with ability, passion, and self-assuredness can accomplish lasting change. We recommend that you vote for the ticket of Noah S. Jessop ’09 and Michael A. Bennie ’10, which is most likely to excel.</p>
